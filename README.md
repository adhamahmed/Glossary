### P1 Provide a definition of what an algorithm is and outline the process in building an application

An algorithm is a step by step process to accomplish a task. It is a well-defined procedure or formula which allows a computer to solve a problem, based on conducting a sequence of specified actions. Within programming, it has a start, a middle, and an end. It is often written as pseudocode, such as a flowchart.

When building an application, the process usually follows a lifecycle model, such as the Waterfall Model which follows the steps:
- Identifying the basic requirements of the application from the client, which will dictate the rest of the development
- Create designs and plan the rest of the project, such as how the requirements will be met and implemented
- Once the outline has been created the language and IDE is chosen to best fit the team working on the programming
- Designs are handed to programmers to create the prototypes, mainly focused on the requirements
- Prototypes are then tested by a focus group, making sure the code works correctly and ensure stability of the application
- The application is continually maintained until possible release, such as bug fixing and updating to keep up to date


### M1 Determine the steps taken from writing code to execution


### P2 Give explanations of what procedural, object orientated and event driven paradigms are; their characteristics and the relationship between them

The procedural programming paradigm is concerned with defining a linear procedure or sequence of programming statements. A key feature of the paradigm is the partitioning of functionality into small re-usable modules called procedures, that act like small programs themselves with their own scope, inputs and outputs.

The object oriented programming paradigm is concerned with modeling problems in terms of entities called objects that have attributes and behaviors and interact with other entities using message passing (calling methods on other entities).

Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of program execution is determined by events - for example a user action such as a mouse click, key press, or a message from the operating system or another program. An event-driven application is designed to detect events as they occur, and then deal with them using an appropriate event-handling procedure. 


### M2 Analyse the common features that a developer has access to in an IDE


### P4 Explain the debugging process and explain the debugging facilities available in the IDE


### M4 Evaluate how the debugging process can be used to help develop more secure, robust applications


### D3 Evaluate the use of an IDE for development of applications contrasted with not using an IDE


### D4 Critically evaluate why a coding standard is necessary in a team as well as for the individual
