### P1 Provide a definition of what an algorithm is and outline the process in building an application

An algorithm is a step by step process to accomplish a task. It is a well-defined procedure or formula which allows a computer to solve a problem, based on conducting a sequence of specified actions. Within programming, it has a start, a middle, and an end. It is often written as pseudocode, such as a flowchart.

When building an application, the process usually follows a lifecycle model, such as the Waterfall Model which follows the steps:
- Identifying the basic requirements of the application
- Create designs from the requirements
- Designs are handed to programmers who create the prototypes
- Prototypes are then tested by a focus group
- The application is continually maintained until possible release


### M1 Determine the steps taken from writing code to execution


### P2 Give explanations of what procedural, object orientated and event driven paradigms are; their characteristics and the relationship between them


### M2 Analyse the common features that a developer has access to in an IDE


### P4 Explain the debugging process and explain the debugging facilities available in the IDE


### M4 Evaluate how the debugging process can be used to help develop more secure, robust applications


### D3 Evaluate the use of an IDE for development of applications contrasted with not using an IDE


### D4 Critically evaluate why a coding standard is necessary in a team as well as for the individual
