### P4 Explain the debugging process and explain the debugging facilities available in the IDE

Debugging is the process of finding and resolving issues within parts of code. It involves a few steps: identifying the cause, determine a solution, and then testing to see if the solution works as intended.

With many IDEs, identifying the bug can be quite simple as it will point you to the line of code that causes the bug. Howevever, without the use of an IDE this part can be a rather difficult if you do not know what you are looking for.
The next step of coming up with a solution is up to the skills of the programmer without an IDE, as if you do not realise what is causing the bug it becomes quite hard to fix it. However, debugging facilities within IDEs are strong enough to help suggest what could be wrong, such as underlining a part of the code that needs fixing.
Testing solutions is as simple as running the code again. With the use of an IDE such as repl.it, the bug will show instantly in red text if there is one. If another bug or the same bug appears, the process starts again.

For the IDE repl.it, there is also a step debugging panel that allows you to step through each part of your code to allow you to go through it all while the code is running.
