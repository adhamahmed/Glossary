### P1 Provide a definition of what an algorithm is and outline the process in building an application

An algorithm is a step by step process to accomplish a task. It is a well-defined procedure or formula which allows a computer to solve a problem, based on conducting a sequence of specified actions. Within programming, it has a start, a middle, and an end. It is often written as pseudocode, such as a flowchart.

When building an application, the process usually follows a lifecycle model, such as the Waterfall Model which follows the steps:
- Identifying the basic requirements of the application from the client, which will dictate the rest of the development
- Create designs and plan the rest of the project, such as how the requirements will be met and implemented
- Once the outline has been created the language and IDE is chosen to best fit the team working on the programming
- Designs are handed to programmers to create the prototypes, mainly focused on the requirements
- Prototypes are then tested by a focus group, making sure the code works correctly and ensure stability of the application
- The application is continually maintained until possible release, such as bug fixing and updating to keep up to date
